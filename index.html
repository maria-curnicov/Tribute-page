                <i><b>Marilyn Monroe</b></i> born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1,
                1926 – August 4, 1962 was an American actress and model. Known
                for playing comic "blonde bombshell" characters, she became one
                of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s, as
                well as an emblem of the era's sexual revolution. She was a
                top-billed actress for a decade, and her films grossed $200
                million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2023) by the time of her
                death in 1962. Long after her death, Monroe remains a pop
                culture icon. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her as
                the sixth-greatest female screen legend from the Golden Age of
                Hollywood. <br />Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent
                most of her childhood in a total of 12 foster homes and an
                orphanage before marrying James Dougherty at age sixteen. She
                was working in a factory during World War II when she met a
                photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a
                successful pin-up modeling career, which led to short-lived film
                contracts with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures.

              <h3>1926–1943: Childhood and first marriage</h3>
              <p>
                Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was 12, and
                they met for the first time in 1944 when Monroe was 17 or
                18.[12] Following the divorce, Gladys worked as a film negative
                cutter at Consolidated Film Industries.[13] Her second marriage
                occurred in 1924 when she married Martin Edward Mortensen, but
                they separated just months later and divorced in 1928.[13][b] In
                2022, DNA testing indicated that Monroe's father was Charles
                Stanley Gifford (1898–1965),[18][19][20] a co-worker of Gladys,
                with whom she had an affair in 1925,[17] though until then, her
                father was thought to be Mortensen.[21] Monroe also had two
                other half-siblings from Gifford's marriage with his first wife,
                a sister, Doris Elizabeth (1920–1933), and a brother, Charles
                Stanley (1922–2015). Although Gladys was mentally and
                financially unprepared for a child, Monroe's early childhood was
                stable and happy.[23] Gladys placed her daughter with
                evangelical Christian foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in
                the rural town of Hawthorne. She also lived there for six
                months, until she was forced to move back to the city for
                employment.[24]

                When her contract at Columbia ended, Monroe returned again to
                modeling. She shot a commercial for Pabst beer and posed for
                artistic nude photographs by Tom Kelley for John Baumgarth[87]
                calendars, using the name 'Mona Monroe'.[88] Monroe had
                previously posed topless or clad in a bikini for other artists
                including Earl Moran, and felt comfortable with nudity.[89][f]
                Shortly after leaving Columbia, she also met and became the
                protégée and mistress of Johnny Hyde, the vice president of the
                William Morris Agency.

                In April 1944, Dougherty was shipped out to the Pacific, where
                he remained for most of the next two years.[58] Monroe moved in
                with her in-laws and began a job at the Radioplane Company, a
                munitions factory in Van Nuys.[58] In late 1944, she met
                photographer David Conover, who had been sent by captain Ronald
                Reagan,[59] then working in the U.S. Army Air Forces' First
                Motion Picture Unit, to the factory to shoot morale-boosting
                pictures of female workers.

              Marilyn Monroe: 5 Facts You Didn’t Know About the Legendary Actor
            </h3>

            <div class="section-3-text">
              <h3>Her birth name wasn’t Marilyn Monroe.</h3>
              <p>
                Marilyn Monroe is one of the most widely recognized stage names
                in the world. The actor was convinced to change her real name,
                Norma Jeane Baker (born Mortenson), by a studio executive in the
                early days of her career, according to Time.

              <h3>Albert Einstein may have been her lover.</h3>
              <p>
                In the late 1940s, actor Shelley Winters shared an apartment
                with Marilyn Monroe—and in her autobiography, Winters claimed
                that Monroe had hinted about a dalliance with the genius.

                Monroe had to be literally sewn into her famous beaded “Happy
                Birthday, JFK” gown.
              </h3>
              <p>
                When Monroe stepped onto the stage at Madison Square Garden to
                sing ”Happy Birthday” to the president on May 19, 1962, she
                tossed a fur stole off her shoulders and there were gasps from
                the crowd—people thought that she was nude. She may as well have
                been: Afterward Adlai Stevenson said, “I don't think I had ever
                seen anyone so beautiful as Marilyn Monroe that night. She was
                wearing skin and beads. I didn't see the beads!”

              <h3>Monroe had a disguise to avoid paparazzi.</h3>
              <p>
                To avoid being recognized in public, Monroe adopted an alter
                ego, Zelda Zonk, by wearing a dark wig and sunglasses. She
                became “a normal” person through Zonk, according to Baker.

                Her home contained an elaborate, government-grade bugging system

              </h3>
              <p>
                A device the size of a “grain of rice” was embedded in her home
                so that others could eavesdrop on the late actor's
                conversations—including ones that took place on the day she
                died. Vanity Fair reported that Paris Theodore, an associate to
                an electronics consultant, heard a fight between Robert Kennedy
                and Monroe on the day of her death.
